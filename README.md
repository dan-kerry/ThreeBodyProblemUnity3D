# ThreeBodyProblemUnity3D

##Overview

**This is very work in progress**

The goal of this project is to create a tool/game/visualisation of the [n-body problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-body_problem).

## Features

- Gravity

## Features (not yet implemented)
- Import custom scenarios
- Pre-calculate each scenario
- UI
- A complete ReadMe

## Instructions

Eventually I want to release this as a standalone Unity executable with all the features listed above, but until then you will need to clone the repo and load it into your 
own project. This was built in Unity **021.3.0f1**
